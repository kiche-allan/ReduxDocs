// Task and TaskList will be stateless functional components, introduced in React
// v0.14. They don’t have access to lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount, only
// accept props, don’t use this.state or this.setState, and they’re defined as plain
// functions instead of with createReactClass or ES2015 classes
